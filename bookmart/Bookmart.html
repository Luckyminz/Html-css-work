                <p class="information">Taylor Swift once said, "The scary news is, you are on your own now. But the cool news is, you are on your own now." The fear of loneliness has been instilled in our minds since we were children. We have learned that the child who eats and sits alone, and has no friends, is often perceived as pathetic. In every book and movie, the character with no friends is typically portrayed as weak and in need of salvation. No one wants to be seen as a "weirdo", hence our dread of being alone. We do not want people to think of us as unwanted or not fitting in with the popular crowd. We do not want people to think that no one chose us. </p>

Man's Search For Meaning</p>
                <p class="information">As relevant today as it was when it was first published Man’s Search for Meaning is a book for finding strength and purpose in times of great despair.“This is a book I reread a lot … it gives me hope … it gives me a sense of strength.”—Anderson Cooper Anderson Cooper 360/CNNViktor E.

                <p class="information">Are you tired of putting off your dreams until "tomorrow"? Guess what, tomorrow never comes. Am I right?

I have procrastinated and put off my desire to write a book for a decade. I always came up with excuses, such as "it's not the right time" or "I need to do more research". </p>
